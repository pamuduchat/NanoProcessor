2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell p_counter/D_FF2/Jump_reg_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) instruction_decoder/Jump_reg/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
